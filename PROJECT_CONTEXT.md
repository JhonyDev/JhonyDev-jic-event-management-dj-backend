## URL Patterns
```python
# Main URLs
/                           # Landing page
/browse/                    # Browse events
/events/<id>/               # Event detail
/events/<id>/info/          # Event information (redesigned)
/events/<id>/agenda/        # Event agenda
/events/<id>/speakers/      # Event speakers
/events/<id>/maps/          # Event maps

# Portal URLs (admin)
/portal/                    # Portal dashboard
/portal/events/             # Event management
/portal/sessions/           # Session management
/portal/speakers/           # Speaker management
```

## Development Context
- **Environment**: Django development server
- **Virtual Environment**: `env/bin/activate`
- **Run Command**: `python manage.py runserver`
- **Git Status**: Working on main branch with multiple modified files

## Key Design Principles
1. **User-Centric**: Interfaces designed for non-technical users
2. **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach
3. **Accessible**: Clear visual hierarchy and readable text
4. **Consistent**: Uniform styling across all components
5. **Professional**: Clean, modern aesthetic suitable for business events

## Technical Debt & Improvements
- SVG icons recently standardized across all templates
- Badge styling made consistent with `text-white` class
- Event avatar system improved with proper fallbacks
- Alert text colors fixed for better accessibility

## Future Considerations
- Event capacity management and waitlists
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Email notification system integration
- Payment processing for paid events
- Multi-language support
- Advanced analytics and reporting

## Development Notes
- Uses Django's template inheritance extensively
- Context processors provide global template variables
- Form handling follows Django best practices
- Admin interface customized for event management workflows
- Static file handling configured for production deployment

This project demonstrates a full-featured Django application with both public and administrative interfaces, modern UI components, and comprehensive event management capabilities.
